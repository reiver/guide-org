# MANAGER ([Org Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

The **role** of a **manager** is:

* to deal with people,
* to deal with alignment,
* to deal with flow
* to be a therapist,
* to deal with blockers,
* to deal with who does and doesn't work on what,
* to deal with what tools are and aren't used,
* to deal with efficiency,
* to deal with velocity.

## Specialization

Someone whose **role** is to be a **manager** would have to have at least one specialization.
Maybe _software development_.
Maybe _UX design_.
Maybe _QA_.
Something.

So, the **manager** has to be a **manager** for some specialization.

Maybe a **manager** for _software development_.
Or a **manager** for _UX design_.
Or a **manager** for _QA_.
Etc.

## Qualification

The **manager** must be qualitatively _better_ at this specialization than anyone they are suppose to **manage**.

Also a **manager** needs to be at least 30% older than anyone they suppose to **manage**.
