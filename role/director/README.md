# DIRECTOR ([Role Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

The **role** of a **director** is:

* to controlling what should and shouldn't happen,
* setting direction of what should be done.

## Specialization

Someone whose **role** is to be a **director** would have to have at least one specialization.
Maybe _software development_.
Maybe _UX design_.
Maybe _QA_.
Something.

So, the **director** has to be a **director** for some specialization.

Maybe a **director** for _software development_.
Or a **director** for _UX design_.
Or a **director** for _QA_.
Etc.

## Qualification

The **director** must be qualitatively _better_ at this specialization than anyone they are suppose to **direct**.

Also a **director** should (if possible) be at least 20% older than anyone they suppose to **direct**.
