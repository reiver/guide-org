by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

The **role** of a **supervisor** is:

* to enforce compliance,
* to exert pressure,
* to be the one who notices if someone doesn't work or doesn't do their job,
* to report any problems with your supervisees to whomever you report to,
* to try to correct any problems, and
* to deal with any problems that cannot be corrected.

For example â€”

* do your job,
* show up to meetings,
* don't slack off,
* 

## Specialization

Someone whose **role** is to be a **supervisor** would have to have at least one specialization.
Maybe _software development_.
Maybe _UX design_.
Maybe _QA_.
Something.

So, the **supervisor** has to be a **supervisor** for some specialization.

Maybe a **supervisor** for _software developers_.
Or a **supervisor** for _UX designers_.
Or a **supervisor** for _QA specialists_.
Etc.

## Qualification

The **supervisor** must be qualitatively _better_ at this specialization than anyone they are suppose to **supervise**.

Also a **supervisor** needs to be at least 30% older than anyone they suppose to **supervisor**.
