# SUPERVISOR ([Org Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

The **role** of a **supervisor** is:

* to enforce compliance,
* to exert pressure,
* to know what each supervisee did and didn't work on each day,
* to be the one who notices if a supervisee doesn't work or doesn't do their job,
* to report any problems with their a supervisee to whomever the supervisor reports to,
* to try to correct any problems with supervisees, and
* to deal with any problems with a supervisee that cannot be corrected.

For example —

* telling supervisees to, “do your job”,
* telling supervisees to, “show up to this meeting”,
* telling supervisees to, “show up on time”,
* telling supervisees to, “don't slack off”,
* telling supervisees to, “do this task”,
* telling supervisees to, “follow this rule”,
* telling supervisees to, “fill out this form”,
* (with permission from whomever the supervisor reports to) telling supervisees to, “do this or you are fired”,
* (with permission from whomever the supervisor reports to) telling supervisees, “you are fired”,
* etc.

## Specialization

Someone whose **role** is to be a **supervisor** would have to have at least one specialization.
Maybe _software development_.
Maybe _UX design_.
Maybe _QA_.
Something.

So, the **supervisor** has to be a **supervisor** for some specialization.

Maybe a **supervisor** for _software developers_.
Or a **supervisor** for _UX designers_.
Or a **supervisor** for _QA specialists_.
Etc.

## Qualification

The **supervisor** must be qualitatively _better_ at this specialization than anyone they are suppose to **supervise**.

Also a **supervisor** should (if possible) be at least 20% older than anyone they suppose to **supervise**.

## Daily Meeting

A **supervisor** must have a **daily meeting** with whomever they are **supervising**.

Likely this meeting will be in the form of a **team meeting**,
where:

* each person is asked if they finished each task they were asked to work on,
* each person gives a status report on each task they were asked to work on,
* if a task has been completed, if possible, it is review during the meeting,
* if the task passed review, then a new task is assigned to that person,
* if the task fails review, the person is asked to make the requested modifications.

## 1-on-1 Meeting

A **supervisor** must have a monthly 1-on-1 meeting with each of their supervisees.
