# Technical Director ([Role Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

A **technical director** (**TD**), along with
the [creative director](role/creative_director/README.md) (CD),
the [product director](role/product_director/README.md) (PD),
the [QA director](role/qa_director/README.md) (QAD), and
the [UX director](role/ux_director/README.md) (UXD),
together (as equals) run a **cross-functional** team.

Despite having "director" as part of the **role**'s title, a **technical director** is more than just a _director_.
A **technical director** is:

* an [administrator](../../role/administrator/README.md),
* an [emissary](../../role/emissary/README.md),
* a [director](../../role/director/README.md),
* a [lead](../../role/lead/README.md),
* a [manager](../../role/manager/README.md), and
* a [supervisor](../../role/supervisor/README.md)

(These are _not_ in order of importance. For example, for a **technical director**, their role as a [supervisor](../../role/supervisor/README.md) is much more important than their role as a [lead](../../role/lead/README.md.).)

## Qualification

The **technical director** must be qualitatively _better_ at the following than anyone that is suppose to report to them:

* software engineering,
* operations, and
* release.

Also a **technical director** needs to be at least 30% older than anyone they suppose to report to them.

## Importance

### First Responsibility

A **technical director**'s first responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [supervisor](../../role/supervisor/README.md).

Nothing else matters if they fail at this.

### Second Responsibility

A **technical director**'s second responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [emissary](../../role/emissary/README.md).

### Third Responsibility

A **technical director**'s third responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [administrator](../../role/administrator/README.md).

### Forth Responsibility

A **technical director**'s sixth responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [manager](../../role/manager/README.md).

### Fifth Responsibility

A **technical director**'s sixth responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [director](../../role/director/README.md).

### Sixth Responsibility

A **technical director**'s sixth responsibility (in terms of importance) is to be a [lead](../../role/lead/README.md).
