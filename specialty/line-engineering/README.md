# Line Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Definition: Line Engineering

The labels “**line**” versus “**staff**” seem to come from the context of militaries.

Someone who is focused on the **line** is out there fighting, doing the _real_ work.

Someone who is focused on the **staff** is, _not_ out there fighting, is _not_ doing the _real_ work, but is instead focuses on the _staff_.

These labels were adopted into **software engineering**.

## Title Ladder

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take a **architecture** path by becoming a **architecture engineer**.

From a **architecture engineer** a software engineer can take a **research & development** (**R&D**) path by becoming a **r&d engineer**.
