# Staff Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Definition: Staff Engineering

The labels “**staff**” versus “**line**” seem to come from the context of militaries.

Someone who is focused on the **line** is out there fighting, doing the _real_ work.

Someone who is focused on the **staff** is, _not_ out there fighting, is _not_ doing the _real_ work, but is instead focuses on the _staff_.

These labels were adopted into **software engineering**.

## Title Ladder

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer**.

From a **senior staff engineer** a software engineer can take a **administative** path by becoming a **engineering manager**.

From a **engineering manager** a software engineer can take on a **supervision** path by becoming a **technical director**.

From there a **technical director** can take a **drection** path and become a **director of engineering**.
