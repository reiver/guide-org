# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Ranks

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given a **rank**.

For example, the following are some common **ranks** for **software engineers** —
junior software engineer,
intermediate software engineer,
senior software engineer.
But there is also —
staff software engineer, principal software engineer, and others.

These **ranks** are labels used to represent a set of responsibilities.

Note that **ranks** usually do _not_ represent what an engineer is capable of.
But instead a **rank** represents what they are expected to actually do, to be effective at, and to be realiable at.

From a high-level, the **ranks** for **software engineers** (without showing the **sub-ranks**) are:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th><a href="../line-engineering/README.md">Path №1 (<strong>line</strong> focus)</a></th>
			<th><a href="../staff-engineering/README.md">Path №2 (<strong>staff</strong> focus)</a></th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" align="center">senior engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3" align="right">architecture engineer</td>
			<td>staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3" align="right">senior architecture engineer</td>
			<td>senior engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">r&d engineer</td>
			<td>director of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">senior r&d engineer</td>
			<td>senior director engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">principal engineer</td>
			<td>vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">senior principal engineer</td>
			<td>senior vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Sub-Ranks

Each of these **ranks** for **software engineers** also has **sub-ranks**.

For example —
senior software engineer Ⅰ,
senior software engineer Ⅱ,
senior software engineer Ⅲ,
senior software engineer Ⅳ,
senior software engineer Ⅴ,
senior software engineer Ⅵ.


## Title Ladder


If we just focus on the first 3 **ranks**, we can look at their (**ranks** and) **sub-ranks** too:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Title</th>
			<th>Level</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</td>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>needs a significant amount of <strong>hand holding</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>does <em>not</em> need <strong>hand holding</strong> if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own <strong>work breakdown</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="6">senior engineer</td>
			<td>Ⅰ</td>
			<td>does their own <strong>work breakdown</strong> for their own tasks, and can largely work independently, if given a task.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅱ</td>
			<td>also does the <strong>work breakdown</strong> for an entire milestone. which means they breakdown other people's tasks.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅲ</td>
			<td>also is <strong>proactive</strong>, effective, and reliable about working with QA.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅳ</td>
			<td>also is <strong>proactive</strong>, effective, and reliable about working with those releasing their what they worked on to the various deployment environments (including production).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅴ</td>
			<td>also is <strong>proactive</strong>, effective, and reliable about addressing emergencies on the production deployment environment.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅵ</td>
			<td>also <strong>helps</strong> & <strong>mentors</strong> one other engineer while still doing their own enginering work.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Line-Engineering versus Staff Engineering

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take 2 different paths.
In classic language — one path that focuses on the **line**, and another path that focuses on the **staff**.

Some call anything in the **line engineering** path a **individual contributor** (**IC**).

We will look at each of these 2 paths separately.

* [staff-engineering](../staff-engineering/README.md)
