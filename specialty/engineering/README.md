| intermediate engineer | does _not_ need **hand holding** if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own **work breakdown**. |
| senior engineer Ⅰ     | can do their own **work breakdown** for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.                    |
| senior engineer Ⅱ     | can also do the **work breakdown** for an entire milestone.                                                     |
| senior engineer Ⅲ     | can **help** & **mentor** one other while still doing their own enginering work                                 |

From a **senior engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer*.
