| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| junior engineer       | needs a significant amount of **hand holding**.                                                                 |
| intermediate engineer | does _not_ need **hand holding** if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own **work breakdown**. |
| senior engineer Ⅰ     | can do their own **work breakdown** for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.                    |
| senior engineer Ⅱ     | can also do the **work breakdown** for an entire milestone.                                                     |
| senior engineer Ⅲ     | can **help** & **mentor** one other while still doing their own enginering work                                 |

From a **senior engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer*.

| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| staff engineer Ⅰ      | can **help** & **mentor** many others                                                                           |
| staff engineer Ⅱ      | can conduct good code reviews                                                                                   |
| staff engineer Ⅲ      | can themselves **train** new hire as part of the new hire's **onboarding**                                      |
| staff engineer Ⅳ      | can create good **training** material themselves                                                                |
| staff engineer Ⅴ      | can do **training** for existing people in company on an ongoing basis                                          |

From a **senior engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **administative** path by becoming a **engineering manager**.

Although it is recommended that a software engineer goes through all the ranks **staff engineer** first, before becoming an **engineering manager**.

| engineering manager Ⅰ | does effective project management                                                                              |
| engineering manager Ⅱ | is an effective liason                                                                                         |
