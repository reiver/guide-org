# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Title Ladder

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given **rank**.
These **ranks** are a labels used to represent a set of responsibilities.

Note that **ranks** usually do _not_ represent what an engineer is capable of.
But instead a **rank** represents what they are expected to actually do, to be effective at, and to be realiable at.

The following describes these **ranks**.


| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| junior engineer       | needs a significant amount of **hand holding**.                                                                 |
| intermediate engineer | does _not_ need **hand holding** if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own **work breakdown**. |
| senior engineer Ⅰ     | does their own **work breakdown** for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.                      |
| senior engineer Ⅱ     | also does the **work breakdown** for an entire milestone. which means they breakdown other people's tasks.      |
| senior engineer Ⅲ     | also **helps** & **mentors** one other engineer while still doing their own enginering work.                    |

From a **senior engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer**.

| Title            | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| staff engineer Ⅰ | also **helps** & **mentors** multiple engineers. might not be coding themselves.                                       |
| staff engineer Ⅱ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior engineer N** become a **senior engineer N+1**                   |
| staff engineer Ⅲ | also conducts good **code reviews** for multiple engineers in a team. see: https://github.com/reiver/guide-code-review |
| staff engineer Ⅳ | also **trains** new hires themselves as part of the new hire's **onboarding**.                                         |
| staff engineer Ⅴ | also **trains** existing people in company on an ongoing basis.                                                        |
| staff engineer Ⅵ | also **interviews** potential new hires                                                                                |

| Title                   | Description                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| senior staff engineer Ⅰ | also does effective **1-on-1** meetings with individual on a single team.                                              |
| senior staff engineer Ⅱ | also creates good **training** material themselves.                                                       |
| senior staff engineer Ⅲ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior engineer Ⅲ** become a **staff engineer Ⅰ**.       |
| senior staff engineer Ⅳ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior staff engineer N** become a **staff engineer N+1**. |

From a **senior staff engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **administative** path by becoming a **engineering manager**.

| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| engineering manager Ⅰ | also does effective & reliable project management, steering meetings, kick-off meetings, etc.                  |
| engineering manager Ⅱ | also is an effective & reliable liason.                                                                        |
| engineering manager Ⅲ | also does retrospectives, etc.                                                                                 |
| engineering manager Ⅳ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior staff engineer Ⅲ** become a **engineering manager Ⅰ**. |


From a **engineering manager Ⅳ** a software engineer can take on a **supervision** path by becoming a **technical director**.

| Title                 | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| technical director Ⅰ | also supervisor for engineers on a single team                                                             |
| technical director Ⅱ | also supervisor for engineers on two teams                                                                 |
| technical director Ⅲ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **engineering manager Ⅳ** become a **technical director Ⅰ**.  |

From there a **technical director Ⅲ** can become a **director of engineering**.

| Title                     | Description                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| director of engineering Ⅰ | also supervises the **technical directors** of multiple teams                                                   |
| director of engineering Ⅱ | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **technical director Ⅲ** become a **director of engineering Ⅰ**. |
