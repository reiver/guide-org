# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Title Ladder

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given **rank**.
These **ranks** are a labels used to represent a set of responsibilities.

Note that **ranks** usually do _not_ represent what an engineer is capable of.
But instead a **rank** represents what they are expected to actually do, to be effective at, and to be realiable at.

The following describes these **ranks**.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Title</th>
			<th>Level</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</td>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>needs a significant amount of <strong>hand holding</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>does <em>not</em> need <strong>hand holding</strong> if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own <strong>work breakdown</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">senior engineer</td>
			<td>Ⅰ</td>
			<td>does their own <strong>work breakdown</strong> for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅱ</td>
			<td>also does the <strong>work breakdown</strong> for an entire milestone. which means they breakdown other people's tasks.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅲ</td>
			<td>also <strong>helps</strong> & <strong>mentors</strong> one other engineer while still doing their own enginering work.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer**.

			<td rowspan="5">staff engineer</td>
			<td>Ⅰ</td>
			<td>also <strong>helps</strong> & <strong>mentors</strong> multiple engineers. might not be coding themselves.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅱ</td>
			<td>also <strong>helps</strong>, <strong>mentors</strong>, and <strong>trains</strong> a <strong>senior engineer N</strong> become a <strong>senior engineer N+1</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅲ</td>
			<td>also conducts good <strong>code reviews</strong> for multiple engineers in a team. see: https://github.com/reiver/guide-code-review</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅳ</td>
			<td>also <strong>trains</strong> new hires themselves as part of the new hire's <strong>onboarding</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅴ</td>
			<td>also <strong>trains</strong> existing people in company on an ongoing basis.</td>

| Title                   | Level | Description                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| senior staff engineer   | Ⅰ    | also **interviews** potential new hires                                                                    |
| senior staff engineer   | Ⅱ    | also does effective **1-on-1** meetings with individuals on a single team.                                 |
| senior staff engineer   | Ⅲ    | also creates good **training** material themselves.                                                        |
| senior staff engineer   | Ⅳ    | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior engineer** become a **staff engineer**.             |
| senior staff engineer   | Ⅴ    | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **[senior] staff engineer N** become a **[senior] staff engineer N+1**. |

From a **senior staff engineer** a software engineer can take a **administative** path by becoming a **engineering manager**.

| Title                 | Level | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| engineering manager   | Ⅰ     | also does effective & reliable project management, steering meetings, kick-off meetings, etc.                  |
| engineering manager   | Ⅱ     | also is an effective & reliable liason.                                                                        |
| engineering manager   | Ⅲ     | also does retrospectives, etc.                                                                                 |
| engineering manager   | Ⅳ     | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **senior staff engineer** become a **engineering manager**.      |
| engineering manager   | Ⅴ     | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** an **engineer manager N** become a **engineering manager N+1**.    |


From a **engineering manager** a software engineer can take on a **supervision** path by becoming a **technical director**.

| Title                 | Level | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| technical director    | Ⅰ    | also supervisor for engineers on a single team                                                             |
| technical director    | Ⅱ    | also supervisor for engineers on two teams                                                                 |
| technical director    | Ⅲ    | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **engineering manager** become a **technical director**.     |
| technical director    | Ⅳ    | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **technical director N** become a **technical director N+1**.    |


From there a **technical director** can become a **director of engineering**.

| Title                     | Level | Description                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| director of engineering   | Ⅰ     | also supervises the **technical directors** of multiple teams                                                      |
| director of engineering   | Ⅱ     | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **technical director** become a **director of engineering**.         |
| director of engineering   | Ⅲ     | also **helps**, **mentors**, and **trains** a **director of engineering N** become a **director of engineering N+1**. |
