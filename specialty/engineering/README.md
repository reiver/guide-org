# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Title Ladder

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given **ranks**.
Those **ranks** are a label use to represent a set of responsibilities.

The following describes these **ranks**.


| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| junior engineer       | needs a significant amount of **hand holding**.                                                                 |
| intermediate engineer | does _not_ need **hand holding** if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own **work breakdown**. |
| senior engineer Ⅰ     | does their own **work breakdown** for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.                      |
| senior engineer Ⅱ     | also does the **work breakdown** for an entire milestone. which means they breakdown other people's tasks.      |
| senior engineer Ⅲ     | also **helps** & **mentors** one other engineer while still doing their own enginering work.                    |

From a **senior engineer Ⅲ** a software engineer can take a **leadership** path by becoming a **staff engineer**.

| Title                 | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| staff engineer Ⅰ      | also **helps** & **mentors** multiple engineers. might not be coding themselves.                                |
| staff engineer Ⅱ      | also conducts good code reviews for multiple engineers in a team.                                               |
| staff engineer Ⅲ      | also themselves **train** new hire as part of the new hire's **onboarding**.                                    |
| staff engineer Ⅳ      | also creates good **training** material themselves.                                                             |
| staff engineer Ⅴ      | also does **training** for existing people in company on an ongoing basis.                                      |
| staff engineer Ⅵ      | also does effective **1-on-1** meetings with individual on a single team.                                       |

From a **staff engineer Ⅵ** a software engineer can take a **administative** path by becoming a **engineering manager**.

| Title                 | Description                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| engineering manager Ⅰ | also does effective project management. |
| engineering manager Ⅱ | also is an effective liason.            |
| engineering manager Ⅲ | also does retrospectives, etc.          |


From a **engineering manager Ⅲ** a software engineer can take on a **supervision** path by becoming a **technical director**.

| Title                 | Descriptio     n                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| technical director Ⅰ | also supervisor for engineers on a single team                                                             |
| technical director Ⅱ | also supervisor for engineers on two teams                                                                 |
| technical director Ⅲ | also can **help**, **mentor**, and **train** a **engineering manager Ⅲ** become a **technical director**. |
