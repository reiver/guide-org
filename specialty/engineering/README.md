# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Ranks

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given a **rank**.

For example, the following are some common **ranks** for **software engineers** —
junior software engineer,
intermediate software engineer,
senior software engineer.
But there is also —
staff software engineer, principal software engineer, and others.

These **ranks** are labels used to represent a set of responsibilities.

⚠️ Note that **ranks** usually do _not_ represent what an engineer is capable of.
But instead a **rank** represents what an engineer is expected to actually do, to be effective at, and to be realiable at.

From a high-level, the **ranks** for **software engineers** (without showing the **levels** within a **rank**) are:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th><a href="../line-engineering/README.md">Path №1 (<strong>line</strong> focus)</a></th>
			<th><a href="../staff-engineering/README.md">Path №2 (<strong>staff</strong> focus)</a></th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" align="center">senior engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3" align="right">engineering architect</td>
			<td>staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3" align="right">senior engineering architect</td>
			<td>senior engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">r&d engineer</td>
			<td>director of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">senior r&d engineer</td>
			<td>senior director engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">principal engineer</td>
			<td>vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="right">senior principal engineer</td>
			<td>senior vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Levels

Each of these **ranks** for **software engineers** also has **levels**.

For example —
senior software engineer Ⅰ,
senior software engineer Ⅱ,
senior software engineer Ⅲ,
senior software engineer Ⅳ,
senior software engineer Ⅴ,
senior software engineer Ⅵ.

The **levels** specify how competent the engineer is at that role;
and specifies _what_ behaviors are desired from an **engineer** to increase their competence.

We will express this in the form of a **title ladder**.

## Title Ladder


If we just focus on the first 3 **ranks**, we can look at their (**ranks** and) **levels** too:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Rank</th>
			<th>Level</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</td>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="4">junior engineer</td>
			<td>Ⅰ</td>

			<td>Ⅲ</td>

			<td>Ⅳ</td>
			<td>
				is <strong>effective</strong> & <strong>reliable</strong> at working on a single <strong>sub-task</strong> from a <strong>task</strong> broken down (by someone else) into a <strong>step-by-step list of sub-tasks</strong> when given a significant <strong>hand holding</strong>.
				<br /><br />
				I.e., they are are now working from a formal <strong>sub-task</strong> specification (likely in some type of TODO-list or issue-tracking software).

		</tr>
		<tr>

			<td>

				<br /><br />
				I.e., they are now working independently on all the <strong>sub-tasks</strong>,
				and thus are able to independently handle the whole <strong>task</strong> (if someone else breaks it down into sub-tasks for them).

		</tr>
		<tr>

## Line-Engineering versus Staff Engineering

The labels “**line**” versus “**staff**” seem to come from the context of militaries.

Someone who is focused on the **line** is out there fighting, and doing the _real_ work.

Someone who is focused on the **staff** is, _not_ out there fighting, is _not_ doing the _real_ work, but is instead focuses on the _staff_.

These labels have been adopted into **software engineering**.

## Above Senior Software Engineer

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take 2 different paths.
In classic language — one path tfocuses on the **line**, and another path focuses on the **staff**.

Some call anything in the **line engineering** path a **individual contributor** (**IC**).

We will look at each of these 2 paths separately.

* [staff-engineering](../staff-engineering/README.md)
