# Engineering (Specialty)

## Definitions: Engineering

The word “engineer” & “engineering” has evolved a bit over time.
Here are 3 different definitions, in chronological order:

**engineering** (noun): The art of managing engines.

**engineering** (noun): The art of directing the artillery of an army.

**engineering** (noun): Any art where one is designing and constructing.

For us, the last one is relevant.

## Definition: Software Engineering

This then gives us the definition of **software engineer**.

**software engineering** (noun): The art of designing and constructing software.

## Title Ladder

In an organization, a **software engineer** is given **rank**.
These **ranks** are a labels used to represent a set of responsibilities.

Note that **ranks** usually do _not_ represent what an engineer is capable of.
But instead a **rank** represents what they are expected to actually do, to be effective at, and to be realiable at.

The following describes these **ranks**.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Title</th>
			<th>Level</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</td>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>needs a significant amount of <strong>hand holding</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>does <em>not</em> need <strong>hand holding</strong> if tasks are broken down for them. cannot yet do their own <strong>work breakdown</strong>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">senior engineer</td>
			<td>Ⅰ</td>
			<td>does their own <strong>work breakdown</strong> for their own tasks, and can largely work independently.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅱ</td>
			<td>also does the <strong>work breakdown</strong> for an entire milestone. which means they breakdown other people's tasks.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ⅲ</td>
			<td>also <strong>helps</strong> & <strong>mentors</strong> one other engineer while still doing their own enginering work.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

From a **senior engineer** a software engineer can take 2 different paths.
In classic language — one path that focuses on the **line**, and another path that focuses on the **staff**.

Some call anything in the **line engineering** path a **individual contributor** (**IC**).

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Path №1 (<strong>line</strong> focus)</th>
			<th>Path №2 (<strong>staff</strong> focus)</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>junior engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>intermediate engineer</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" align="center">senior engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">line engineer</td>
			<td>staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior staff engineer</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="3">senior line engineer</td>
			<td>senior engineering manager</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior technical director</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="2">principal engineer</td>
			<td>director of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior director engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td rowspan="2">senior principal engineer</td>
			<td>vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>senior vp of engineering</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
