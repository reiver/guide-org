# GUIDE: role

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

This **guide** describes **roles** within a company.
And in particular the responsibilities for each of these **roles**.

---

## Type of Roles

* [administrator](role/administrator/README.md)
* [director](role/director/README.md)
* [lead](role/lead/README.md)
* [manager](role/manager/README.md)
* [supervisor](role/supervisor/README.md)

## Team

The teams are **cross-functional** teams.

The following roles exist on a **cross-functional** team.

A single person on the team might do more than one of these **roles**.

And, for some of these **roles**, a single person could be on more than one team.

There are different types of ways a **cross-functional** team could be configured.
This is one way:

The **team** is collectively run by whomever provides each of these:

* administration
* direction
* leadership
* management
* supervision

for each of these:

* engineering
* operations
* product
* release
* QA
* UX
* work

Likely this would NOT be (5×7=) 35 people.
But some individuals would do more than one of these roles.

For example, a technical director would be expected to do the administration, direction, leadership, management, and supervision for engineering, operations, release, and the work. I.e., the technical director would be expected to take on (5×3=) 15 of these roles.

## Cross-Functional Team

A typical **cross-functional** team will have the following who run the team:

* [creative director](role/creative_director/README.md) (CD)
* [product director](role/product_director/README.md) (PD)
* [QA director](role/qa_director/README.md) (QAD)
* [technical director](role/technical_director/README.md) (TD)
* [UX director](role/ux_director/README.md) (UXD)

Each of these individuals are equal in terms of positional power.

Which, in terms of responsibilities can be understood as:

| .              | eng | illus | ops | prod | rel | qa  | ux  |
|----------------|-----|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|
| administration | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |
| direction      | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |
| leadership     | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |
| management     | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |
| supervision    | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |

In terms of **work administration** (i.e., what some call _project management_) the following take on those responsibilities:

| .                   | eng | illus | ops | prod | rel | qa  | ux  | 
|---------------------|-----|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|
| work administration | TD  | CD    | TD  | PD   | TD  | QAD | UXD |

And will have the following that do the actual work:

* [back-end developer](role/back-end_developer/README.md)
* [front-end developer](role/front-end_developer/README.md) or [mobile developer](role/mobile_developer/README.md)
* [illustrator](role/illustrator/README.md)
* [QA specialist](role/qa_specialist/README.md)
* [UX designer](role/ux_designer/README.md)
